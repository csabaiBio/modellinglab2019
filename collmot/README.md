# Group dynamics in wild horse population - effect of male foals on harem stability


## Introduction

The wild horse herd living in isolation in Pentezug, Hortobágy, consists of 
approximately 300 individuals. This group breaks into smaller harems, which 
typically consist of several mares, their foals, and usually one harem stallion. 
Female offspring leave the natal harem at the age of 2–3 years and join other
harems; males leave at the age of 2–4 years (or even later) and join with other
non-breeding but already dispersed males and former harem stallions to form 
single-sex bachelor groups. The harems show an interesting dynamics as they 
change over the years: their size may increase or decrease, harem stallion
can be replaced after a successful bachelor attack. Furthermore, harems can 
merge or get completely dissolve into other harmes.

proximity are likely to be members of the same harem, while foals can be seen
even closer to their mothers [[3](#Literature)]._

are presented except bachelors. Names indicate the harem stallion, red circles
indicate stallion changes. **c** Data visualisation from the long-term population

## Project

The goal of the project is to examine how male foals that stay in their natal
harem for a shorter or longer period influence the stability of the given harem.
For that data exploration is needed and necessary quantities should be defined
and calculated. Once the real-data based results are available, an additional 
model may be proposed and supported by simulation results.


## Summary of the datasets

The dataset available for the project includes records from over 80 field 
observations conducted over 20 years. For each of the 80 observation dates, 
the observed harem ID-s, the members of those harems, and the names of the 
harem stallions are provided. Additionally, kinship data are also available.



## Steps

1. Understand and visualize the dataset
2. Define necessary quantities and extract them from the data
3. Analyse results and discuss findings
