# Hydrodynamics

Here you can experiment with one of the mostly used Computational Fluid Dynamics softwares.
The [OpenFOAM](http://www.openfoam.com/) package is able to simulate and solve several problems in
Turbulence and in Problems with thermal energy and compressible fluids.

## Background materials:

- [Overview](http://csabai.web.elte.hu/http/simulationLab/jasakEtAlOpenFoam.pdf) (H. Jasak et al, International Workshop on Coupled Methods in Numerical Dynamics IUC, Dubrovnik, Croatia, September 19th-21st 2007)
- The [concept](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/applications/#x8-630003) of the OpenFOAM and its language. The full [User Guide](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/).
-  [OpenFOAM tutorial](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/tutorials/#x4-30002). These will be our first examples. There are more new tutorials [here](https://wiki.openfoam.com/index.php?title=Tutorials).


## Steps

1. Familiarize yourself with the concept and software structure based on the above background materials

2. Download and install the package

3. Read the [tutorial](http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/tutorials/#x4-30002) and reproduce at least two of them
for.

4. Select an interesting research project, and reproduce the results. Refer to citation archives and find manuscripts that cite this package.
